Self Organization Is All You Need

# Modeling the cluster mapping and overlapping of motor units into a form of motor neurons in primary motor, premotor, and supplementary motor cortex

# Cluster mapping modeled using Kohonen's self organizing maps structured hierarchically

# Model must be able to perform "decently" (must be defined explicitly later) in given environments

 # Should start by making the agent learn to perform specific tasks explicitly defined by reward function

 # How well does it capture the dynamics of the system at hand?

 # Sequential execution of the tasks

 # Move on to unsupervised learning of the said tasks

# Unlike DIAYN and its derivatives or other DRL papers, we attempt to model this in a manner where analysis and the visualization of the decision making can be easily performed

 # Not encoding the learnt parameters into vague weight values in layered architectures

# Questions

 # PID control is used for lower-level (premotor and primary motor cortex) control in order for less complication of the problem

 # Currently trying the problem on pole-balancing. But is conceptualizing and controlling the cart good enough for this task? More "biological" tasks such as locomotion and inverse kinematics should be taken into consideration
