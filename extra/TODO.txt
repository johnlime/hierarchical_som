1. Using an approximation of state and action spaces not be appropriate when the task is to arrive to an unstable fixed point. (3.1)

2. Since the goal of the algorithm is to mimic the cerebral cortex, research results in that field should be taken into consideration for better understanding and engineering.

3. Hierarchical structure could be used for more complex sequential tasks

3.1. Can SOM be adapted to deal with unstable dynamical systems? (1)

4. May be a good idea to attmept implemention of FALCON for reference
