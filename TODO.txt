1. Should test cartpole with PD control beforehand
DONE

2. (Derivative of error should be the difference between derivative of reference and current signals)
DONE

2.1. "Additional states" may have to be organized in a different SOM model
TESTED: UNDESIRABLE RESULT

2.2. Using an approximation of state and action spaces not be appropriate when the task is to arrive to an unstable fixed point. (3.1)

2.3. Since the goal of the algorithm is to mimic the cerebral cortex, research results in that field should be taken into consideration for better understanding and engineering.

3. Hierarchical structure could be used for more complex sequential tasks

3.1. Can SOM be adapted to deal with unstable dynamical systems? (2.2)
