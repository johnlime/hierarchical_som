1. Should test cartpole with PD control beforehand
DONE

2. (Derivative of error should be the difference between derivative of reference and current signals)

2.1. "Additional states" may have to be organized in a different SOM model

3. Hierarchical structure could be used for more complex sequential tasks

3.1. Can SOM be adapted to deal with unstable dynamical systems?
