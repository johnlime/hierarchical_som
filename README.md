# Modeling Representation Overlap in Motor Cortices using Self Organizing Maps (som_rl)
Understanding the functionalities of the motor cortex of the human brain has been a major fo- cus of research in the field of neuroscience. While neuroscientific research regarding the motor cor- tex has shown evidence of topological preserva- tion and self organization of motor output signals, models presented in preliminary works fail to de- pict such aspect and its integration into trial-and- error learning. Our research proposes a model which attempts to tackle such problem by uti- lizing Kohonenâ€™s self organizing map and a rein- forcement learning framework.
